# EX-02-Cross-Platform-Prompting-Evaluating-Diverse-Techniques-in-AI-Powered-Text-Summarization

## AIM
To evaluate and compare the effectiveness of prompting techniques (zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought, role-based) across different AI platforms (e.g., ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, Copilot) in a specific task: text summarization.

## Scenario:

### Step 1:

Summarize the following 500-word article on ‚ÄúThe Basics of Blockchain Technology‚Äù in 120‚Äì150 words for undergraduate students. Keep it clear and beginner-friendly.


### Step 2 (Feedback):

Please revise the summary to make it even simpler and include at least two real-world examples of blockchain applications.

## Algorithm
Got it ‚úÖ
You want to set up a **structured experiment** where different prompting techniques (zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought, role-based) are tested across AI platforms like ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, and Copilot for the **same summarization task**.

Here‚Äôs how we can present it:

# **Experiment Report: Prompting Techniques for Text Summarization**

### **AIM**

To evaluate and compare the effectiveness of prompting techniques (zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought, role-based) across different AI platforms (ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, Copilot) in summarizing text.

### **Scenario / Task**

**Step 1 ‚Äì Task Definition**
Summarize a 500-word article on *‚ÄúThe Basics of Blockchain Technology‚Äù* in **120‚Äì150 words**, written for undergraduate students.
The summary must be **clear, beginner-friendly, and concise**.

**Step 2 ‚Äì Feedback Revision**
Revise the summary to make it **even simpler** and include at least **two real-world blockchain applications**.

### **Algorithm**

**Step 1: Define Prompting Techniques**

* **Zero-shot prompting** ‚Üí Ask the model to summarize directly without examples.
* **Few-shot prompting** ‚Üí Provide 1‚Äì2 examples of good summaries before asking.
* **Chain-of-thought prompting** ‚Üí Ask the model to ‚Äúthink step by step‚Äù before summarizing.
* **Role-based prompting** ‚Üí Ask the model to act as a ‚Äúprofessor teaching undergraduates‚Äù or similar role.

**Step 2: Select AI Platforms**
ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, Copilot.

**Step 3: Run Summarization Task**
Each model is tested under all 4 prompting methods.

**Step 4: Evaluate Results**
Criteria:

* **Clarity** (easy for undergraduates?)
* **Accuracy** (captures blockchain basics correctly?)
* **Length** (120‚Äì150 words)
* **Beginner-friendliness**
* **Use of real-world examples** (after feedback revision).

**Step 5: Compare & Analyze**
Tabulate results across platforms + prompting methods.

### **Result (Sample ‚Äì Using ChatGPT, Zero-Shot Prompting)**

**Step 1 ‚Äì Initial Summary (Zero-shot, ChatGPT):**
Blockchain is a digital system that securely records transactions across a decentralized network of computers. Instead of relying on one central authority, information is stored in blocks linked together, making it transparent and hard to tamper with. This technology ensures trust, security, and efficiency in areas like digital payments, supply chain management, and data storage. Blockchain‚Äôs strength lies in its immutability and distributed nature, which reduce fraud and errors.

**Step 2 ‚Äì Feedback Revision (Simpler + Real-world Examples):**
Blockchain is like a shared digital notebook used by many computers worldwide. Once something is written in it, no one can easily change it. This makes it secure and trustworthy. For example, **Bitcoin uses blockchain** to record money transactions without banks, and **Walmart uses it to track food supply chains**. Students can think of it as a safe and transparent way to store information that everyone can see but no one can secretly edit.

üëâ I can now **fill out a comparison table** showing how each AI platform (ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, Copilot) performs under the **four prompting methods** for this task.

Do you want me to **generate the full comparison table** (like a research report result) or just keep it at one worked-out example (ChatGPT only)?
